# Why

I created this because searching for places that are actually good on Google Maps is incredibly hit or miss and I've wasted hours in doing so.

## Moats

- **Review parsing:**
  - Parse reviews (e.g., on maps) to find common menu items and must-tries, catered to extensive user data.
- **Social:**
  - Allow users to take pictures at places. This adds to our data and is key for getting referrals from friends.
  - It’s like sharing a Spotify playlist with a friend—maybe also a “Spotify Wrapped” for places?
- **Daily recommendation:**
  - Suggest a new cafe, library, or other spot to visit each day.
- **Data:**
  - Leverage user instructions and reviews.
  - Use AI to ask relevant questions (e.g., “What desserts did you have and what was your favorite?”) to remove friction for reviews.
  - Collect images of the restaurant, receipts, etc.
